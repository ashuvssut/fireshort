Fireshort is an open-source project which helps organizations to setup thier very own instance of URL Shortener. They can deploy all of this with no cost at all.

I am Ashutosh Khanduala, an undergraduate student from VSSUT, Burla.

This project was mentored by - Anubhav Singh. The project had constant guidance from him.

## Contributions

[21 commits](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/commits?author=ashuvssut)

In this project I have added features that adds extra functionality and improves user interaction. I have also reduced the time taken by the redirect process.


1. Added feature that checks URL's validity

- A very exciting part of working on fireshort for me was to a feature that ensures valid long URL is allowed to be shortened. when we do a ping to any server, if the server gives any status-code in response then the long URL is considered valid. This helped me to explore various things like CORS and firestore.
 	- [[#8]](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/pull/8) Check if long URL exists before shortening
  
2. Speed Up Redirect process
 
- I implemented React [Code Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html). This helps users to load only those components on a page that the currently displaying web page needs, instead of, loading the entire app.
	- [[#13]](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/pull/13) Implemented Code Splitting

3. UI improvements
 
- In this task, I was responsible for adding a warning dialog box to prevent accidental overwriting on existing custom urls.

- This part helped me understand how meterialui components work. I have never used React before. But all of this gave me a better understanding about the basics of React.
	- [[#12]](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/pull/12) Added warning dialog box to prevent accidental overwriting upon existing custom urls

4. Miscellaneous

- Opened an issue: [[#11]](https://github.com/xprilion/fireshort/issue/11) [BUG: UI] `LinearProgress` component is not showing its intended behavior

## Acknowledgments
I had an exciting winter of 2020, working on Fireshort under the Winter of Code program. I am glad to be mentored by Anubhav Singh (thanks for your valuable tips and advices about open-source contributions and good practices. Thanks for reviewing and going through all my PRs online and giving me feedback about the mistakes I have done in my works). It really helped me to get exposure about GSoC process. I feel lucky for the exposure I got from this event.

I extend my gratitude to my fellow contributor Lucky Kumari who helped me in this whole open source event.

WoC with Fireshort was a warm and unforgettable experience for me. Everytime I talk of Open Source, WoC Fireshort will be the first thing to come to my mind.
